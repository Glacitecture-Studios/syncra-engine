# Contributing to Syncra Engine

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Syncra Engine**! Your help is what makes this project grow into a powerful tool for rhythm game development. This document will guide you through the contribution process.

## Before You Start

- Ensure you're using the latest version of **Godot Engine 4.x**.
- Familiarize yourself with how the editor is structured (see `README.md`).
- Read this document thoroughly before submitting a pull request.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, crash, or usability problem, please open an issue on GitLab with the following:

- Clear and descriptive **title**
  - This should be short (around 1 medium-length sentence max), but should be as descriptive as you can make it so we can understand the gist of the bug before going into further detail.
- Steps to **reproduce the issue** (Bug Reports missing reproduction steps that are NOT marked as 'not reproducible' will be deleted)
- Screenshots or video if applicable
- System information (OS, GPU, Engine Version, etc.)
- Any relevant logs or stack traces

Before you post, make sure that:

- Your issue is NOT a duplicate
- Your issue is correctly labelled and tagged
- Your issue does not cover a bug that has already been disproven or fixed
- Your issue does not cover an outdated version of Syncra Engine

If we find the bug to be reproducable and valid, it will be marked with the `bug` tag and a `risk` tag according to the level of risk the bug introduces.

## Requesting Features

We welcome new ideas! Please include:

- A clear problem statement or use case
- How your idea improves Syncra Engine
- Optional: mockups or code examples

We label viable feature ideas with `enhancement` and may discuss them before approving a PR.

## Want to make a custom Syncra Runtime Library?

**Please contact us first.** Generally, we don't mind people making custom external libraries for Syncra Engine but in the case of our Custom Runtime Libraries for different game engines, we ask that you get explicit authorization from us first.
This is typically because we may already have plans to expand to these engines and we want to avoid having the confusion between third-party CRLs (custom runtime libraries) and the official ones made by us.

## Code Styling Guidelines

- Use Godot GDScript style conventions (4.x).
- Name files and folders clearly and consistently (snake_case or PascalCase).
- Use tabs (not spaces) in GDScript.
- Add comments for complex logic. (This is SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO THIS, People will not spend hours and hours deciphering your code. Please be considerate of other developers.)
- Organize scenes and scripts in appropriate subfolders (ui/, editor/, core/, etc).
